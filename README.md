ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS AND PRIVACY – LEVERAGING CRYPTOGRAPHY TO GAIN CONTROL 

This project researches the state of online social networking platforms in regards to privacy with a focus on Facebook. 

In addition it discusses existing and, in the context of social networks and mobile phones, novel mitigation techniques that enable users to take control and prevent unauthorized users from accessing their social networking data. A mobile application, codenamed “Project Cryptbook” is implemented that leverages client side encryption capabilities before posting information to the social network. This will 
prevent the social networking platform or other users, who do not possess the appropriate decryption key, to recover the plaintext message. 

In addition to encryption, Project Cryptbook enables signing capabilities for posts, which further improves the security of the user accounts and the integrity of messaging on the social network. If an account gets compromised, the attacker is not able to post on a user’s behalf because the victim’s private signing key is not accessible from within the social network.

The mobile application is implemented for Windows Phone 7. 

I built this in 2011 as part of my MSc at the University of Liverpool, so they code is outdated and prototype like.
